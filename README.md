<h1>Language Detection Model using Machine Learning and NLP</h1>

<h1>Objective:</h1>
The objective of the project is to develop a language detection model that can accurately identify the language of a given text. This will leverage Machine Learning (ML) techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build a system capable of classifying text into predefined language categories.

<h1>Data Description:</h1>
The dataset consists of a single table with the following columns:<br>
•	Language: The language to which the text belongs(e.g., English, Spanish, French, etc)<br>
•	Text: the actual textual data in various languages.<br>

<h1>Data collection and preprocessing:</h1>
•	Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicate rows and non-text entries.<br>
•	Text Normalization: Convert the text to lowercase, remove punctuation, numbers, and any irrelevant symbols.<br>

<h1>Feature Engineering:</h1>
CountVectorizer: Converting raw text data into a structured format that can be processed by machine learning model.

<h1>Model Selection and Training:</h1>
•	Naïve Bayes: Often effective for text classification tasks.

<h1>Model Evaluation:</h1>
•	Accuracy: Measure how often the model makes correct predictions.

<h1>Outcome:</h1>
A reliable language detection model capable of identifying the language of a given text high accuracy. The model should be able to handle a diverse set of languages and provide real-time prediction for any input text.

<h1>Tool and Technologies:</h1>
•	Programming Language: Python<br>
•	Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, CountVectorizer<br>

<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
The 95% accuracy achieved in this language detection project demonstrates that the model is highly effective at identifying languages from text input. Future improvements could focus on handling multilingual input, real-time detection for even more sophisticated language recognition.
